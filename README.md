# Daily Display (mostly done)
* e-ink display provides the day's weather conditions such as temperature and humidity
* the display is based around the pico-pi w
* feel free to use the e-ink display firmware for your pico-pi (c/c++)


# current issues
* weird pixel alignment issue (might have to do w/ pixel representation)
